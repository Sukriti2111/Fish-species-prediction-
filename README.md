# Fish Species Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict the species of fish based on various features. The project includes a frontend webpage where users can input data and get predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Fish Market dataset from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market).

## Model

The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier to classify fish species. The following features are used:

- Weight
- Length1
- Length2
- Length3
- Height
- Width

## Frontend

The frontend is built using HTML and CSS. It provides an interface for users to input data and get predictions from the model.
